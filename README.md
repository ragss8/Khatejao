1.Introduction:
This is a clone of food delivery app , that basically should do things like
- user logins orders a food
- the system picks up near by drivers
- assigns them and show them on the map
- real location,Just like how swiggy works but with minimal operations.


2.what has been done the past week?
-Home page , that has welcome page and the rendering of main component and auto detect the location using "opencageData"
-It has got signup and Login Buttons to access the main component.
*On clicking you get the forms for respective users may be the
--Application_User
--Restaurant_Owner
--Delivery_Partner
*Same goes on with the Login 
IMPLEMENTED BACKEND CODE FOR CREATIN USER, LOGGING IN, STORING THE INFO FOR THE SAME, LOGOUT(Not working as of now,as implemention for storing the session_tokens and logging out is remaining)endpoints.
Note: Both for Login and Signup The forms render on the same page on the App Component as an overlay.


3.->The implementation for major operations is done .
  what has been implemented?
--Storing the Restaurant Information by post Request.
--Using Redux thunk retrieving the RestaurantDetails as a prop to show the Restaurant_Name,delivery_Time and contact_Info as of now and show up in the Restaurant_Container
--same goes for Delivery like Storing the Delivery_Partners Information.
-adding menuItems under the Object_id's of the restaurant and storing the same and making it accessible on the restaurantList-container, this would be ready for selecting the items and adding it to cart for ordering it.
